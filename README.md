# CentralTendency Case Study

## Project Overview

#### This project aims to analyze the quality of wines based on various chemical properties. 
The dataset used contains details of red and white wine samples, including attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide,
total sulf dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol content, and wine quality rating.

## Objectives:

#### Explore the distribution and central tendency of key chemical properties in the wine dataset.
#### Analyze the relationship between these properties and the overall quality of the wines.
#### Provide insights and recommendations for improving wine quality based on the analysis.

## Tools Used
- PYTHON
- PANDAs
- NUMPY
- MATPLOTLIB
- SEABORN
- JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

## Analysis:
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
#### Utilized histograms to visualize the distribution of key chemical properties, including volatile acidity, fixed acidity, and citric acid.
#### Incorporated mean and median lines to highlight the central tendency measures within each distribution.
### Quality Rating Analysis:
#### Employed a count plot to visualize the distribution of wine quality ratings.

## Findings:
#### Mean Value of Fixed Acidity: The mean value of fixed acidity in the wine dataset is 6.8.
#### Mean Value of Volatile Acidity: The mean value of volatile acidity in the wine dataset is 0.2.
#### Mean Value of Citric Acid: The mean value of citric acid in the wine dataset is 0.33.
#### Count of Quality Ratings: The dataset contains a total of 6 different quality ratings.
